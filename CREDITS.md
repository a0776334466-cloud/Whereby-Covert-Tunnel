# 🏅 Project Credit and Foundational Research

The core concept and initial Proof-of-Concept (PoC) code for using H.264 Motion Vectors (MV) for steganography were developed in the following academic work:

## Original Research: TorKameleon
* **Researcher:** Afonso Vilalonga
* **Topic:** Steganography in video calls for censorship circumvention.
* **Original Repository:** https://github.com/AfonsoVilalonga/TorKameleon

This repository is a community initiative to evolve this research into a deployable, robust solution that can survive transcoding by live WebRTC services (such as Whereby). We thank Afonso Vilalonga for their groundbreaking work and all current and future contributors for taking on the engineering challenge.
